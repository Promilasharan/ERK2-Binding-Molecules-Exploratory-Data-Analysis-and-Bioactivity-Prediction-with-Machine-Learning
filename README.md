# ERK2-Binding-Molecules-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Bioactivity-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
This repository contains code for importing small molecules that bind to MAP kinase ERK2 from the ChEMBL database, performing exploratory data analysis and molecular data analysis, and using machine learning techniques to predict their bioactivity against ERK2.
