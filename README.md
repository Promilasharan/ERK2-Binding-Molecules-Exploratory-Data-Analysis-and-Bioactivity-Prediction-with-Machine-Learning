# ERK2-Binding-Molecules-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Bioactivity-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
This repository contains code for importing small molecules that bind to MAP kinase ERK2 from the ChEMBL database, performing exploratory data analysis and molecular data analysis, and using machine learning techniques to predict their bioactivity against ERK2. 
# Introduction

MAP Kinase ERK2 (Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2), also known as MAPK1 (Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1), is a protein that belongs to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. It plays an important role in cellular signaling pathways that regulate processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. ERK2 is activated by phosphorylation through a cascade of protein kinases in response to a variety of extracellular signals, such as growth factors, cytokines, and stress, and it then translocates to the nucleus to modulate gene expression.

ERK2 is involved in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, gene expression, protein synthesis, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, and cell survival. Dysregulation of ERK2 signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, and inflammation. As a result, ERK2 has become an important target for drug development, and numerous small molecule inhibitors have been developed to modulate its activity.

In this repository, we use machine learning techniques to predict the bioactivity of small molecules against ERK2. This can aid in the identification of potential drug candidates that can modulate ERK2 activity.
